As for me, finishing this project allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge. I learn about the
issue we're having by interviewing people and doing a survey. We try to gather all the ideas of
group members to solve the problem. Even though it was initially just a draft, I'm amazed that
we were able to design the app that we imagined. Other than that, I am learning about computer
applications and software through this project. We have the opportunity to discuss the
preliminary stages of application development with this design thinking project. We will develop
both our hard and soft skills, such as team communication and design thinking methodology, to
maximise our potential in the field. Although, we encounter a few problems during the process
of this project but in the end we manage to complete it. It is my goal to continue assisting people
in resolving their issues in the future. I'm hoping to stay current on the latest issues because I
know this field will make people's daily lives easier
