Dr. Seah’s Technobizz webinar became the catalyst for my profound re-evaluation of innovation and its potential applications. 
The presentation highlighted the transformative power of turning creative ideas into workable solutions, emphasizing the need for 
proactive implementation to address society's real challenges. Dr. Seah’s insights into the diverse applicability of innovations beyond 
the technical realm, impacting areas such as agriculture, broadened my horizons. I am now motivated to think creatively and explore 
unconventional avenues to make a meaningful contribution to the welfare of the community. This webinar not only reshaped my perspective on 
innovation but also instilled a sense of responsibility to actively participate in and improve the world around me.
