  In conclusion, starting the process of learning how to assemble a PC has been a very fulfilling experience that involves many aspects that go beyond the 
simple act of assembling parts. The procedure gave me a great sense of satisfaction in addition to providing me with a comprehensive understanding 
of the complex interactions between various computer parts, including the motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, and storage devices.
My ability to solve problems was put to the test during the assembly process as I encountered and overcame obstacles. Every obstacle I 
faced, whether it was figuring out hardware problems or making sure everything worked smoothly, gave me the chance to improve my capacity for 
identifying and fixing technical issues, which broadened my skill set and made me more resilient and adaptive.
