Being at the industrial talk given by Miss Qistina changed my life and gave me a fresh outlook on 
the technology industry. A useful link between theoretical understanding and real-world applications was 
made possible by Miss Qistina experience and practical insights into system development. I was 
demonstrated by complex problem-solving abilities and inventiveness needed in this industry. In addition 
to enhancing my comprehension of the difficulties in creating reliable systems, the talk caught my interest 
in learning more about cutting-edge technologies. After reading about the Miss Qistina difficulties and the 
creative solutions she used, I'm motivated to approach problem-solving with more dynamism and 
adaptability.This experience has reaffirmed my commitment to continuous learning and has motivated me 
to actively seek opportunities to apply these insights in both my academic and future professional endeavors.
