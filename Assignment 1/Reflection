  I have always been curious about what skills are transferable from our university lives to our working lives. I learnt that a lot of what we go through as students 
are preparing us for our working lives: things such as time management, theoretical knowledge which will enhance our practical skills and also our ability to self 
learn and explore beyond the contents of our classes. This talk has also reassured me that soft skills such as communication and listening are vital in the 
working environment and we are trained for it through various groupÂ assignments.
